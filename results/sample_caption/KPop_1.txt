The video opens with three animated characters standing side by side, each holding a cup of instant noodles. The character on the left has long pink hair and is wearing a black top with red text and yellow pants. The middle character has purple hair styled in a bun and is dressed in a yellow jacket with colorful patterns. The character on the right has short black hair and is wearing a strapless top with a green and blue design. They are all holding chopsticks and appear to be eating their noodles. The background is a vibrant mix of purple and blue hues, suggesting a lively setting. As they eat, their expressions change to show enjoyment. The scene then transitions to a close-up of the middle character, who is now standing alone against a backdrop of clouds and a dark sky, gesturing with their arms as if speaking or singing passionately. The final part of the video shows the three characters falling through the air, surrounded by glowing blue lines and a bright light source below them. They land on a rooftop, where the character with purple hair is seen climbing up the roof, indicating a sense of urgency or escape.
