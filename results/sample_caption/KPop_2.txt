The video opens with three animated characters standing on a rooftop at night, overlooking a cityscape. The character in the center has purple hair and is wearing a beige hoodie, while the character on the left has long pink hair and is dressed in a light blue outfit with a cat design. The character on the right has short black hair and is wearing a purple dress with geometric patterns. The character in the center raises their arms in excitement, followed by the other two characters doing the same. The scene transitions to a title card that reads "FROM NETFLIX AND SONY PICTURES ANIMATION THE STUDIO BEHIND SPIDER-MAN ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE." The final scene shows the three characters performing a synchronized dance routine on a brightly lit stage with an audience holding glowing lights.
