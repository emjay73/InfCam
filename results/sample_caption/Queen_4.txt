The video opens with a woman standing in front of a modern building with large glass windows. She is dressed in a dark outfit and appears to be adjusting her hair or headband. The background shows a well-maintained garden with flowers and a few people walking by. As the scene progresses, text appears on the screen, starting with "THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT" and then adding "OCTOBER 23." The woman remains in the same position throughout the video, while the text changes and additional people walk past her. The setting suggests an outdoor area, possibly a campus or public space, given the presence of other individuals and the structured environment.
