The video takes place in a well-furnished room with a classic, elegant interior. The room features a large chessboard on a round table surrounded by several chairs. A woman with red hair is seated at the table, deeply engrossed in playing chess. She is dressed in a light-colored dress and appears to be contemplating her next move. The room has a vintage feel, with a large sign reading "GRAND PRIX DE CHÉCIS" hanging on the wall behind her, suggesting a historical or themed setting. The lighting is soft and natural, coming from a window on the right side of the frame. The overall atmosphere is one of concentration and strategic thinking as the woman plays the game.
